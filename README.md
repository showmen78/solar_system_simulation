# solar_system_simulation


This was a fun project where I created a **Solar System Simulation** using **JavaScript**. The goal was to visually simulate the movement of planets around the Sun while gaining a better understanding of the mathematical details behind orbital mechanics. 

Through this project, I explored concepts like planetary motion and gravitational forces, all while enhancing my coding skills. It was a great learning experience that allowed me to combine my passion for astronomy with programming.
